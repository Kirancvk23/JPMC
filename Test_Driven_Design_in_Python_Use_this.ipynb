        "import unittest\n",
        "```\n",
        "- The `unittest` module is a built-in Python library used to create and run tests. It provides the tools necessary to write test cases and validate that code behaves as expected.\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "- This class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, which provides various methods (like `assertEqual`) to create test cases.\n",
        "- `CalculatorTest` will hold the tests for the functionality we want to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Writing the `test_add` method**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def test_add(self):\n",
        "    result = add(2, 3)  # Function 'add' is not yet defined\n",
        "    self.assertEqual(result, 5)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Purpose**: This is a test case to check if the `add` function works as expected.\n",
        "- **What happens**:\n",
        "   - The method `test_add` calls the `add(2, 3)` function and stores the result in the `result` variable.\n",
        "   - The method then uses `self.assertEqual(result, 5)` to check if the `result` is equal to 5.\n",
        "   - If the `add` function returns 5 when adding 2 and 3, the test will pass; otherwise, it will fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Key Insight: No `add` function yet**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = add(2, 3)  # Function 'add' is not yet defined\n",
        "```\n",

        "This example follows the **Test-Driven Development** cycle, which consists of three steps:\n",
        "1. **Write a test**: You write a test that defines how a function (in this case, `add`) should behave. This test describes what the function should do, without worrying about the function's actual implementation yet.\n",
        "2. **Run the test and see it fail**: Since you haven’t implemented the function yet, the test will fail. This failure confirms that the test is set up correctly and that you need to write the function to make it pass.\n",
        "3. **Write the code to pass the test**: After the test fails, you implement the `add` function and rerun the test. Once the implementation is correct, the test will pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how you would implement the `add` function after running the initial failing test:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Implement the `add` function:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Rerun the test:\n",
        "After adding this code, if you rerun the test, it will pass because the function `add` now returns the expected result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The TDD Cycle:\n",
        "- **Red**: The test is written and fails because the function isn’t defined yet.\n",
        "- **Green**: You write just enough code to make the test pass.\n",
        "- **Refactor**: You refactor the code to improve it, while ensuring that the test still passes.\n",
