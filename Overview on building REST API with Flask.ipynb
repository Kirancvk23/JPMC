   "source": [
    "This code sets up a simple RESTful API using **Flask** and **Flask-RESTful**. Here's a breakdown of the code and what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Importing necessary libraries:**\n",
    "   - `Flask`: The core library for creating web applications in Python.\n",
    "   - `jsonify`: A helper function to return JSON responses.\n",
    "   - `request`: To access incoming HTTP request data (for example, when sending data in POST requests).\n",
    "   - `Api` and `Resource`: Components of Flask-RESTful, which helps structure the API resources in an organized way.\n",
    "   - `Thread`: From Python's `threading` module, used to run the Flask app in a separate thread, so that it can run in the background (useful for running in a Jupyter Notebook, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Creating the Flask app and API instance:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "   api = Api(app)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This initializes a Flask app and binds the Flask-RESTful `Api` to it. The `Api` instance allows easy creation of RESTful routes and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Dummy data (List of books):**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   books = [\n",
    "       {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"George Orwell\"},\n",
    "       {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Brave New World\", \"author\": \"Aldous Huxley\"},\n",
    "       {\"id\": 3, \"title\": \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"author\": \"Ray Bradbury\"}\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This is a list of dictionaries representing a set of books with `id`, `title`, and `author`. This data serves as the backend storage for books.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Defining the `Book` resource:**\n",
    "   The `Book` class is a RESTful resource that defines the behavior for GET, POST, and DELETE requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **GET request:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def get(self, book_id=None):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - If no `book_id` is provided, it returns the entire list of books.\n",
    "     - If a specific `book_id` is provided, it searches for the corresponding book and returns it. If the book isn't found, it returns a 404 error with a \"Book not found\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **POST request:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def post(self):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - It reads JSON data from the request body and appends the new book to the `books` list, then returns the newly added book with a 201 status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **DELETE request:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def delete(self, book_id):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - It searches for a book by `book_id` and removes it from the `books` list. If found and deleted, it returns a success message. Otherwise, it would still return 200 if the book doesn't exist (this logic could be expanded).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Adding the `Book` resource to the API:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   api.add_resource(Book, '/books', '/books/<int:book_id>')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This binds the `Book` resource to two endpoints:\n",
    "   - `/books`: Handles requests that work on the entire book collection (e.g., GET all books or POST a new book).\n",
    "   - `/books/<int:book_id>`: Handles requests that work on specific books by `book_id` (e.g., GET or DELETE a single book).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Running the Flask app in a separate thread:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def run_flask():\n",
    "       app.run(port=5000)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Thread(target=run_flask).start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This function starts the Flask app on port 5000, but instead of blocking the main thread (which is a problem if you are running this code in a Jupyter notebook or an environment that needs to stay interactive), it runs the Flask app in a background thread using Python's `Thread`. This allows the web server to run while other code can continue executing in the notebook or environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of API Operations:**\n",
    "- **GET /books**: Retrieve all books.\n",
    "- **GET /books/<book_id>**: Retrieve a specific book by its `book_id`.\n",
    "- **POST /books**: Add a new book to the list. The new book data must be sent as JSON.\n",
    "- **DELETE /books/<book_id>**: Remove a specific book from the list by its `book_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This API is a simple demonstration of how Flask-RESTful can be used to create a REST API, handling basic CRUD operations for a list of books."

    "This code uses the `requests` library in Python to interact with a REST API (specifically, the API you created in the previous Flask example). Hereâ€™s an explanation of what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Importing the `requests` library:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `requests` library is a powerful Python package used to send HTTP requests and interact with web servers. It makes it easy to perform various types of requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Sending a GET request to fetch the list of all books:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/books')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`requests.get`**: This function sends a **GET** request to the specified URL, which in this case is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/books`. This URL points to the local instance of the Flask application that serves the list of books.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The GET request is targeting the `/books` endpoint, which is defined in your Flask application to return all the books in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`**: This is the URL of the locally running Flask server. `127.0.0.1` refers to the local machine (localhost), and `5000` is the port number where the Flask app is running.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The response from this request is stored in the `response` variable. This `response` object contains various attributes, including the status code of the HTTP request, response headers, and the actual content (data) returned by the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Printing the JSON response:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(response.json())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`response.json()`**: This method converts the response content (which is in JSON format) into a Python dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the JSON.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Since the `/books` endpoint returns a list of books, this will be converted into a Python list of dictionaries (each dictionary representing a book).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`print(response.json())`**: This prints the parsed JSON data, which should be the list of books (as defined in the Flask application).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "Assuming the Flask API from the earlier example is running and has the dummy data of books, the output would be something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"George Orwell\"},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Brave New World\", \"author\": \"Aldous Huxley\"},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 3, \"title\": \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"author\": \"Ray Bradbury\"}\n",
